# EDSR Super Resolution in PyTorch

This repository contains a clean and clear PyTorch implementation of EDSR algorithm described in
CVPR2017 workshop Paper: ["Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02921.pdf) 
for both CPU-only and GPU users. The official implementation of the algoirthm can be referred 
[here](https://github.com/sanghyun-son/EDSR-PyTorch).

##Usage
The complete running of the system is composed of three stages: data preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. It's totally fine to skip the first two parts and go straight to the evaluation
as long as you have the weight file the model needs (pre-trained weight files are provided for downloading
in the evaluation section).
